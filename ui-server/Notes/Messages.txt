      passwords are present and are identical.

   Logic Checking
      Note: assume the email adress is a unique index
      Note: assume the ID is an auto increment field
      Note: for now, we will just process this locally, and not worry about creating 
      accompanying records on an EMS anchor server.

      Start/resume session

      Validate the parameters 
      If this fails, return an HTTP error 400 (bad request)
      Json:
         error: 400
         message: "message that reflects the validation failure"
         sessionid: session value (need to understand how this is done)   
      

      Encrypt the pertinant fields (first/last name, phone numbers, email address)
      Hash the password
      Assign appropriate initial values for the fields not recevied in the request:
         user_role?  (make this an enum ('admin' or 'normal'))
         account_state: email-pending
         account_type: trial
         email_verf_code: ''
         phone_verf_code: ''
         pwd_forgot_code: ''
         account_create_date: current date 
         account_expired_date: for now, hard code this to 30 days

      Attempt to insert the record into the User's table.
      If (Success) 
         update the session info with this user's information
         build return message
      else (fail)
         build return message with:
         error: 500
         message: error message if you can figure it out

      Send response along with the session id
